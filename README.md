### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

A Computer Engineer by training, Iâ€™m currently pursuing my UG at SRM Institute of Science and Technology. Enthusiastic to learn just about anything and just a little curious on how things work in this world. I keep a keen interest in Machine Learning, Data science and Quantum Computing. I've also wrote several articles on Medium and Learning Pie Club and have published a research paper in QML. Iâ€™m open to exploring positions in industry and academia in the broad field of ML, Data science and experimental Quantum technologies.
